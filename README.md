# Baby Name Generator RNN
## Purpose
- Train a RNN to automatically generate baby names based on textgenrnn package
- Provide sibling with innovative, sleek, and "savvy" names for soon-to-be born niece!

## Project Breakdown
- `baby_names.ipynb`: Jupyter Python Notebook containing code for training and output of names
- `baby_names_config.[ ]`: Model files for textgenrnn object
- `set_names.txt`: Text file containing all names registered with US Social Security in 2018. Names are only captured once in the dataset (i.e., 17,000+ Olivia's were registered in 2018 but this dataset only contains one entry for Olivia) so as to encourage more "creative" generated names.
